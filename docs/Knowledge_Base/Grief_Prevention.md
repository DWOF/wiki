#GriefPrevention (protect your land)

 

##Create a claim

Use your first Chest to create a claim or use a golden shovel and click two corners with it to create your claim. If you use the golden shovel to create a claim then you have to make sure that the claim is at least 10x10 blocks, or else it will not work. Everything in this claim is protected from outsiders.
If you right click inside a claim with a stick, the edges of the claim will be highlighted with glowstone along the edges and gold blocks in the corners. Thes blocks are not actual blocks and will disappear when interacted with. If you wish to hide these, you can wait for them to disappear, or right click with a stick outside the claim. If you try to claim an area that overlaps another person's claim, their claim will be highlighted with netherrack along the edges and redstone ore in the corners. Again, Thes blocks are not actual blocks and will disappear when interacted with.
 
##Trust a player

To grant someone the permissions to build in your claim you have to use the command ``/trust [Player]`` during you are in your claim. If you run the command outside one of your claims then the player will be trusted in all your claims.
It is also possible to revoke the permissions by running the command ``/untrust [Player]``.
 
##Delete a claim

You can delete one of your claims or all of your claims. To delete a single claim you need to stand in the claim, use the command ``/abandonclaim``, and then use it again to confirm the action. If you want to delete all your claims you need to use the command ``/abandonallclaims``, and then use the command again to confirm it.
