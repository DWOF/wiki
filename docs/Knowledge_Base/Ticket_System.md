Staff get notified in-game as soon as you make a ticket. If they are able to deal with said ticket, 
They will claim that ticket and then proceed to help you. Once it has been claimed, it is their
responsibility to see that ticket to its completion in a timely and professional manner.

Please remain online while the staff reviews your ticket. If you are not online, we cannot help you in most cases.
