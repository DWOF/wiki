#Plugins

Here on the FrozenSoul Network we host a range of modpacks with a host of plugins that we have hand-picked to give you, the player the best experience possible.


##BetterChunkLoader

This plugin replaces all other chunkloaders ingame.
Each chunkloader can load up to 9 chunks and it has options for 1x1 & 3x3
When loading chunks, the chunk that the chunkloader is in, is the center.

###Usage

To use BetterChunkLoader all you need is an Iron block and a blaze rod.

1. Place down the block, anywhere is fine just be aware of the chunk borders so you are loading the expected chunks. (press F9 to see chunk outlines)

2. With your blaze rod in hand right click on the chunkloader you want to activate. Make sure you do this step immediately after placing the block otherwise you will have to place down the block again.

3. Select the appropriate option for the number of chunks you want to load in the GUI that opened by simply clicking one of the options. After this step it should tell you Chunk loader created and now you're good to go!

##Essentials

This plugin is a backbone of our server.

It allows you to Teleport, use homes, and many other things.

##Forge Restrictor

Forge Restrictor interacts with WorldGuard and GriefPreventionPlus to help protect your claim from greifers. 
This plugin allows us to restrict item useage near another players base that you aren't trusted in.
So if you see yourself momentarily drop an item your trying to use, this could be whats causing it.
Please check around you for other land claims and when you first build try build away from other people whose land you arent trusted in.

##GriefPreventionPlus (GPP)

GriefPreventionPlus is the plugin that we use to help protect your land!

It has many awesome features and is a absolute breeze to use!

All you need to do to protect your land is:  
1. Find the right spot in the overworld to setup your base  
2. Place a chest  

It's as simple as that! Now you have a 9x9 block claim surrounding your chest.

Be sure to expand the claim or else it will disappear in 7 days.

If you wish to expand the claim, all you have to do is:  
1. Grab a Golden Shovel (you should have gotten one in the starter kit)  
2. While holding the shovel, right-click a corner of your claim  
3. Right-click where you want to expand the claim to  

Easy-peasy! 

If you don't have enough claimblocks to make the claim, or theres another issue with it, GPP will let you know.
