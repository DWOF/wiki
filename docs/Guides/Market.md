# Market
Hey! We have a new market system, and at first glance, it can be quite intimidating. Don't worry! Here's a step by step guide on the new features of the system!
These steps are also displayed in game, but not as in depth as this post.

## Step 1:
Run the command "/market" in chat. (no quotes)


## Step 2:
Click the left chest named stock at the bottom


## Step 3:
Place the amount of an item you wish to sell on the dark grey squares.
You can add more than a stack by placing it on top of the pre existing item.


## Step 4:
Right click the item to go into the listing creation GUI.
You should now see 1 red glass pane, 2 of the items you wish to sell, and a green glass pane.
Clicking the red glass pane will cancel the listing creation; your items will still be in your stock (shop storage) but they will not be up for sale.
The 2 item icons are named price and amount. The first icon changes the price and the second icon changes the amount. (More on this below)
The default price and quantity is $1 for 1 item, even if you placed 3 stacks of the item in your stock!
If you wish to sell a stack at a time, mouse over the icon named amount and press any number 5-9. (you can only sell a stack at once so doesn't matter wich number you press)
After that, you migth wanna adjust the price. It may seem tricky at first, but trust me, it's easy.
The default price is $1 per quantity, if you mouse over the item and press 1 you're increasing the price with $1, and if you then left-click, you decrease with 1 again. 
The text says to press 1-9 (can not use numpad for this) to change the price, and here is the scale for each number:
1 will increase the price by $1
2 will increase the price by $5
3 will increase the price by $10
4 will increase the price by $50
5 will increase the price by $100
6 will increase the price by $500
7 will increase the price by $1000
8 will increase the price by $5000
9 will increase the price by $10000

The only tricky part is that you're always starting on $1. If you press number 3 your price will be $11, and if you left-click it will decrease with the same amount you increased with.
To get an even number like 20 easily, you can to press number 3 two times (you're now on 21), then press number 1 once (now on 22), and then you can left-click 2 times to go down to $20.
(you could also press 1 x19 if you wish)
If you wish to sell a quantity of an item between 1 and 64, here is the scale for that too (numpad still does not work):
1 will increase the quantity by 1
2 will increase the quantity by 2
3 will increase the quantity by 3
4 will increase the quantity by 4
5-9 will increase the quantity to a stack (64)

When you're happy with the price per amount and quantity, click the green glass pane to put your items up for sale.
Once you put an item up for sale, you can not edit the price or amount. The only way to change the price or ammount is to shift-click the sale to remove the listing, and recreate the listing.
When you remove a listing, the items will be placed in your stock.
