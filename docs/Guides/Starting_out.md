#Starting out on FrozenSoul

Upon  joining any server for the first time, you will be placed in the spawn area of that world. Building is not permitted in the spawn area. To find a place to build you must either walk until you're outside the boundary of the spawn area, or you can type the command "/rtp" to teleport to a random place somewhere in the world until you find a suitable area.
