#Starting out on FrozenSoul

Upon newly joining any server you will be placed in the spawn area of that world. Building is not permitted there. To find a place to build you must either walk until you're outside the boundary of the spawn's admin claim, or you can type the command "/rtp" to teleport to a random place somewhere in the world until you find a suitable area.
