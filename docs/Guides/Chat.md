#Chat

By default your chat channel is set to the local channel of the server you are currently playing on. You can see global chat by default as well but must type /g [message] to talk in it.

To private message someone you can run the command: /msg [name] [message]

Global chat is in green text, local chat is in white text, and private messages are in pink text. If you have sounds on for minecraft you will hear a little sound when receiving a private message.

If you for some reason don't wish to see local or global chat, you can easily disable them temporarily with /leave global or /leave local. To enter the channel again, you can simply send a message in that channel. Whenever you log out from the server these settings will go back to default again.
