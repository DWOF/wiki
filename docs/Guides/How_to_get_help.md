#How to get help on FrozenSoul

These are listed in order of preference and what is most likely to get you help the fastest!

###Create an in-game ticket (/ticket)
The best way to get help ingame is to make a ticket! 
Simply create a ticket in-game (/ticket message). While it is a bit limited due to Minecraft's character limit, this will notify us that you need help and we can get back to you. It also tells us the precise location you create the ticket, saving time and solving your issue faster! BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE. This will help us to assign the right staff member to suit the problem, as some of us know more about some mods than others.

###Simply ask in chat or in global (/g)
A lot of issues are simply from incorrectly configured blocks or interactions between mods and can normally be helped if you simply ask in chat or using our global chat (/g <message>). 
Most of our players (including staff, we're players too) would be more than willing to help troubleshoot you and can also offer help to small issues, incase you cant figure out how to hook something up to make it work.

###Private Message (/tell) a member of staff
Our staff team is friendly and very knowledgeable. If you have any questions about something or need to report a bug or dupe, message us, we'll be more than willing to help. 
How you should go about contacting us in-game is by first asking a Helper or Mod, from there we'll continue up to the Mod+'s and Admins as needed. 
Just be aware that no-one is special enough to go around the chain of command (even us ^.^), so please start with the lowest ranking staff member online.

###Join our TeamSpeak (ts.frozensoul.co)
Most of the time, even if we're not on in-game, we are on in TeamSpeak. Simply download TeamSpeak from [right here](http://www.teamspeak.com/downloads). 
After you have it installed and join our server, feel free to poke us or simply come into the Available Staff channel where we normally hang out. 
From there, we'll be able to help you the best we can. Also, feel free to invite your friends, there are plenty of lobbies for you and your friends to talk in while playing.

###Create a ticket online
You can create a ticket on our website [here](http://www.frozensoul.enjin.com/ticket)
This may take longer to solve your issue, however an assigned staff member will get a notification when a ticket is created.
This method is good if there is an issue on the website itself

###Create a Forum Post (http://frozensoul.enjin.com)
If all else fails and for some reason you don't hear back from us within 2 days, make a forum post. 
Be sure to use specific details about your problem and we will try and help you the best that we can either by finding you in-game, or by contacting you through the forums.
This method is also great for getting help with a mod or something that someone else might come across in the future.
