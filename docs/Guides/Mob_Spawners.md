#Mob Spawners

If you want to make mob-spawners in your base, there are some basic rules you should follow:

* All spawners need an easy way to turn them on and off without having to risk your life. (Preferably outside the spawning area)

* You need to kill all the mobs you spawn. Make sure this is fast and automated as piles of mobs will make the server lag, and no one likes that.

* You need to collect all drops from the mobs you kill. Make sure this is fast and automated as piles of drops will make the server lag and no one like s that.

* Turn off the spawner when you log off.

If we find your spawner online, spawning stuff faster than the grinder can kill, or dropping more items than your system can pick up, we will turn it off and tell you to fix it.  

Warning: If there is no off-switch to be found and you're not online, we will simply break the spawner and stick it in a chest with a sign.
